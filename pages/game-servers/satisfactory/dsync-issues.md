# Dsync Issues

Satisfactory servers can suffer from huge dsync issues. Items placed might not show, or show as invisible. Items can also look like they’re there on your client, but they’re not there on the server. Causing machines not to work correctly.

These faults are down to the game itself. Upgrading your server sadly won’t fix errors like this. Satisfactory is still in early access, and issues like this is something they’ll work out over time.

If you do have dsync issues, please report them to the game devs via the bug tracker, rather than our support team.
