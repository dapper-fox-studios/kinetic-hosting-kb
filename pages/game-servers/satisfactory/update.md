# How To Update A Satisfactory Server

By default, all you need to do is restart your server. On restart, the server will check for the latest version and download it.

This can be disabled in the settings, so if your server isn’t updating, check here.

The settings page has a number of options, one of them is if the server should automatically update. 0 means it shouldn’t, 1 means it should. Make sure this box is set to 1 if you want the server to update.
