# Setting Header Images For Server Listings

If you would like to set a header image for the server list. Head to the settings page and look for the box marked Server Image. Here you can set the URL of the image you would like to use

## Image Size & Format

The image needs to be a png or jpg and should be 512×256 or 1024×512

## Hosting The Image

You can host the image on a web server, dropbox, or we’ll host the image for you. Just reach out to support and we’ll give you a link you can use.

If you’re using dropbox, simply upload the image, and copy the direct link. If the link ends in dl=0, make sure to change it to dl=1. Otherwise, the image won’t work.
