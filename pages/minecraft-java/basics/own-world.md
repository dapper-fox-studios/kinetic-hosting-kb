Uploading your own world is version simple. We can do this via the file manager, or SFTP.

The file manager is the easy way, so we'll cover that here.

### Step 2
Once the file is zipped. Head to the file manager on the panel.
Upload the zip file

Once uploaded right-click on the folder and press unarchive
