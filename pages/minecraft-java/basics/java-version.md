# Changing Java Version
Newer versions of Minecraft now require a newer version of Java. This can be different depending on what you’re running, but to know the correct version of Java needed, a good rule to follow is:

1.18+ (All versions) – Java 17

1.17 (All version) – Java 16

1.16 (Paper and Arclight) – Java 11

All lower versions and 1.16 (if not running paper or arclight) – Java 8

## Running The Wrong Version
If you’re running the wrong version, your server will not load. Our panel should detect this is the case, and show you this box
