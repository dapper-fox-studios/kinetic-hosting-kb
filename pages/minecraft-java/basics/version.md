# Selecting Version

To keep it simple, our panel has a version installer built into it. It has all the most popular jars for Minecraft already built-in.

You can find the version installer under the Tools tab.

Simple select the category, then the version you need.


### Setting Jar and Java Version
Once the version has been downloaded make sure the jar and correct java version is set in the settings page.

All jars downloaded will be called server.jar

To know the correct Java version, a good rule of thumb to follow is:
1.18+ - Java 17
1.17 - Java 16
Paper 1.16 - Java 11
1.16 and Under - Java 8
