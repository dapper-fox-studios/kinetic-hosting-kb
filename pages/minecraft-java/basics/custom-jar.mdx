  If a jar is fairly new, or fully custom made by you. Our security tools might flag the jar. If this is the case, please open a ticket

If our version installer doesn’t have the jar/version you’re looking for, you can upload it via our file manager.

To do this, simply upload the jar in the file manager, then set the jar name in the settings page.
