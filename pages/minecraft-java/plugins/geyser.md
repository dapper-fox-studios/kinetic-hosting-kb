# Installing Geyser
Geyser allows for bedrock players to join your server.

First, to install geyser we need to be running a sever software that supports bukkit plugins. We recommend Paper, but Bukkit/Spigot will also work.

Once this is installed, head to the plugins folder.

Download Geyser from here: https://ci.opencollab.dev//job/GeyserMC/job/Geyser/job/master/

You’ll be needing the version for Spigot. So Geyser-Spigot.jar

We’re also going to be downloading Floodgate. If we don’t use Floodgate Bedrock players will have to login with their Java account before joining the server.

You can download Floodgate here: https://ci.opencollab.dev/job/GeyserMC/job/Floodgate/job/master/

We’re looking for the Jar called floodgate-spigot.jar

Now upload both these jars to the plugin folder, and restart the server

## Opening Port

Alright, now we have the plugins installed, we now need to open the port. If you don’t own a dedicated IP, you’ll need to contact our support team. You can do this via Discord or the billing panel.

If you own a dedicated IP, you can head to the Network & Port tab, and open the port: 19132

Bedrock players can now join from {yourIP}:19132
(Note, if you don’t have a dedicated IP, your port might be different. A support agent will tell you the port on setup)
