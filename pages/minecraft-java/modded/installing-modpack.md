# Installing A Modpack
Installing a modpack on our panel is simple. We support all modpacks, even custom ones made by yourself.

When installing a modpack, you have two paths to take. You can upload the modpack, or you can use our modpack installer. We’ll fist cover using the modpack installer, however, if you’re running your own custom modpack, you’ll want to just right to the upload section

## Modpack Installer
To keep things simple, we’ve added a modpack installer to our panel. Here you can download all the most popular modpacks, with a press of a button.


You can find the modpack installer under the Tools dropdown.
Here all the modpacks are divided into categories. For example, if the modpack you’re looking for is hosted on Curse Forge, you’ll find it under the Curse Forge tab.



Once you’ve selected a category, you’ll be given a page like this. Here you can see the version of the modpack, the version of Minecraft it’s for, and a little bit about the pack.
To install, first shunt down the server. You can do this with the stop button at the top. Then press the green install button. That’s it! You’ve just installed the pack.

## Uploading
If the modpack you want to use isn’t listed or is your own custom modpack, you’ll need to upload it yourself. If reading isn’t your thing, we’ve made a fancy video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpabl5rOylo



Alright, first we need to upload the files of your pack. So this should be the mods, configs, etc. You can do this via the file manager.
This is found under the manage option.

The best way to upload your files is the first zip them. Once this zip is uploaded, you can then unzip the files, by pressing the unarchive button.

If you’re told one of your files is too big, then you’ll need to use SFTP to upload the files. You can find out how to do that here

Once the files are uploaded, you now need to select the correct version. You can do this by uploading your own jar, or using our version manager. You can find out more about that here
