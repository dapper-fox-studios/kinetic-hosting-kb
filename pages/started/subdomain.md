# Sub Domain Manager

The sub domain manager allows for you to set a custom sub domain for your server. To make a domain, head to the sub domain manager, type in the domain prefix, and then the domain you would like to use. We have a few options in the dropdown for you to choose from. 

You can then use your selected sub domain to connect to your server. Please note, some games may not support sub domains.
