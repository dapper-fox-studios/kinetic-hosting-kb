# Database
To make a Database for your server, head to the Database section under Advanced. 

When making a Database you'll first see a box that will allow for you to set the name and the connections. 
The connections allow you to limit the IPs that your Database can be accessed from. A % will allow every IP access.

You may want to limit connections from just your server as an extra security layer 

## Managing A Database
Once the database is made, you'll see it in the list. There you can see the IP, connections, and Username. To see more info press on the eye icon.

Here you can also see the password for you Database.
