# Import Tool

If youâ€™ve come from another host, you can use our server import tool to download all of your files.

To do this, your old host will need to have allowed access to FTP, SFTP, or FTPS. If this is not the case, then please contact our support team

To use the import tool head to the SFTP & Import section of the panel. This can be found under advanced.

Select import server, then enter the information from you old host into the boxes. Make sure to check first if you old host uses FTP or SFTP. This should be marked on their panel, if you're unsure, please contact our support team.

The server will then start to import. Note depending on the size of your files, this could take up to an hour.
