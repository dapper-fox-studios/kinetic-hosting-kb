# How To Login

So you’ve ordered your new Kinetic Hosting server. Amazing! Now we need to login to the panel.

After you ordered your server, you should have had a few emails. Some will have been from our billing system confirming the order, another one should be from the panel. Note, you’ll only get the panel email once your payment has been fully completed. (Check your spam/junk folder)

If you don’t have an email, then please contact our support team.

Once you’ve got the email, simply follow everything it says to set up your login.

That’s it! You’re done. Just login to your account here: https://game.kinetichosting.net/
