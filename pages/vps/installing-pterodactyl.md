# Installing Pterodactyl
If you’re looking to run games on your dedicated server, then we recommend installing a free panel called Pterodactyl. This panel is simple to use, and have support for most games.

You’ll need to install both the Panel and Wings. You can find the guide on how to do that here: https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html

If you don’t know what any of this means, then please reach out to our support team, and we can install the panel for you.
